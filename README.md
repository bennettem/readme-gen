# readme-gen

This is a README generator so that you can quickly create a README for a new project. 
By using the command-line application the user will begin to input data.
The user will be prompted with several questions to complete their README.
  * Title of project
  * Description of project
  * Installation
  * Usage
  * License
  * Contribution info
  * Tests
  
  
After the user completes all the prompts the README will be generated!
